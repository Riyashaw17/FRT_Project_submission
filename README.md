# FRT_Project_submission
I have tried to make a query bot related to fin-tech, which answers all queries related to Loan system.
As Loan system can be complicated and confusing to some extent, so to help the users with the said problem, a query bot specific to that could be helpful.
# Services used and details
I have used QnA maker to build up a knowledge base and then created a web app bot in the azure portal. 
Next, I used the "static web app" service to host my bot. 
I pushed the html file(written on Visual studio Code) to Github Repo named 'FRT_Project_submission'. 
Then I created a static web app by signing in with my github account and deployed it.
